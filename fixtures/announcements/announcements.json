The transistor revolutionized the electronics industry, allowing the Information Age to occur, and made possible the development of almost every modern electronic device, from telephones to computers to missiles. Bardeen's developments in superconductivity, which won him his second Nobel, are used in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) or its medical sub-tool magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</div><div><br /></div><div>RACHEL CARSON <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre;\">\t</span></div><div><br /></div><div>She was a writer, scientist, and ecologist who wrote many literary works to inform the public about nature, such as the book Silent Spring, in which she wrote about the dangerous effects of pesticides and tried to convince people to view the world in a different perspective. In 1963, she testified in front of Congress and called for policies to protect human health and the environment. She should be honored at TJ because she helped start the environmental revolution and changed the way we look at our world.</div><div><br /></div><div>GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre;\">\t</span></div><div><br /></div><div>African-American inventor who had the highest number of patents at his time solely for the benefit of food consumption. He was a pioneer in all fields of science: chemistry, physics, botany and biology.</div><div><br /></div><div>VINT CERF\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>He is a 'father of the Internet,' and, along with Bob Khan, created TCP/IP, the Transmission Control and Internet Protocols, the basis of the technology which would help create the Internet. He has connections to TJHSST (his son attended TJ) and has won numerous awards including the National Medal of Technology, the Turing Award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</div><div><br /></div><div>JACQUES COUSTEAU\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>He once described a scientist as 'a curious man looking through a keyhole, the keyhole of nature, trying to know what's going on.' Cousteau was passionate about the sea, and I admire him for using his talents in writing and film-making to draw much-needed attention to ocean conservation.</div><div><br /></div><div>MARIE CURIE\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>She is an exemplar and a pioneer for not only science, but also women in science. As the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person-- and only woman-- to win the Nobel Prize twice, she risked her life to bring forth breakthrough theories on radioactivity (a term she coined) and would ultimately pass away due to her extensive exposure to radiation, the epitome of scientific dedication until the end.</div><div><br /></div><div>LEONARDO DA VINCI\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>The definition of a Renaissance man, da Vinci was not only famous for his art, but also for his work with anatomy, engineering, geology, botany, cartography, architecture, music, and mathematics. \u00a0I can think of no better person to represent the various interests that can be found at TJ.</div><div><br /></div><div>CHARLES DARWIN\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Without Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, biology is just a collection of facts without a unifying theory. As Theodosius Dobzhansky said in his 1973 essay: 'Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution'.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>ALBERT EINSTEIN\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Einstein was above everyone else in that he didn't simply accept other scientists' theories. After discovering that the speed of light remains constant, he spent years researching its correlations with speed and mass and eventually reached a breakthrough where he discovered relativity.</div><div><br /></div><div>LEONHARD EULER\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>He and Carl Friedrich Gauss vie for the title of greatest mathematician of all time. Euler contributed more than any other person to the field of mechanics (both fluid and solid).</div><div><br /></div><div>MICHAEL FARADAY <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre;\">\t</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Michael Faraday displayed the true spirit of science even though he lacked a formal education. Faraday made many important discoveries about electricity, which helped create the world we live in today. I think we should name our commons the 'Faraday Commons' to honor this genius who so truly deserves it.</div><div><br /></div><div>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Franklin was a self-made entrepreneur, turned renaissance man, turned patriot, who, embraced the best scientific and political elements of the Enlightenment. \u00a0His wisdom and cunning helped give birth to the United States as a society that made real the fantasy of popular government in an organic form that would facilitate, however slowly, the incubation and evolution of ideas such as justice and scientific advancement.</div><div><br /></div><div>ROSALIND FRANKLIN\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Though Franklin was instrumental in the discovery of DNA's structure, she received no credit for it at the time. Even now, she is frequently excluded from the 'Watson and Crick' narrative. I think it's important that we recognize the contributions of those often left out of lists of scientific pioneers and that we include female scientists and Rosalind Franklin fulfills both of those criteria.</div><div><br /></div><div>GALILEO GALLILEI\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>The father of modern astronomy who supported the advancement of science against the persecution of the church (there were widely different belief systems in the early 17th century).</div><div><br /></div><div>MAHATMA GANDHI\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Despite the fact that Gandhi was an extremely well educated lawyer, he was a pioneer in the field of non-violent social activism. He is a reminder to us all that we must use our education to create a difference in the world, and due to the fact that we are recieving a world-class education it is our duty to become the leaders of tomorrow and take the baton to be the next Gandhis, because there is so much change that still needs to occur.</div><div><br /></div><div>CARL FRIEDRICH GAUSS\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>His contemporaries called him princeps mathematicorum, prince of mathematics. We can call a mere lobby by his name.</div><div><br /></div><div>GRACE HOPPER</div><div><br /></div><div>As a female pioneer in the computing field, Rear Admiral Dr. Grace Murray Hopper was a remarkable woman who contributed to the transition from primitive programming techniques to the use of sophisticated compilers. \u00a0A mathematician, military officer, and computer scientist, she is an amazing role model for women. \u00a0Her belief that that the statement 'we've always done it that way' is not necessarily a good reason to continue to follow the status quo is an ideal that could inspire TJ students for many years to come.</div><div><br /></div><div>MAE JEMISON <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre;\">\t</span></div><div><br /></div><div>A physician who became the first female African American astronaut and first black women to go into space.</div><div><br /></div><div>FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre;\">\t</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Innovative American Architect.</div><div><br /></div><div>JOHN LOCKE\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Locke thought of ideas that incredibly affected the founding of the US. His theories on government and the social contract were vital to Thomas Jefferson when he wrote the Declaration of Independence.</div><div><br /></div><div>THURGOOD MARSHALL <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre;\">\t</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Lawyer-Changed history in 1954 when he successfully argued Brown vs. the Board of Education before the Supreme Court. Also played huge role in NAACP cases and was selected as first African-American Supreme Court Justice.</div><div><br /></div><div>ISAAC NEWTON <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre;\">\t</span></div><div><br /></div><div>All TJ students will grow to hate this guy for inventing two of the most terrifying things ever: calculus and physics. It is both fitting and hilarious that Newton's name be integrated within the very foundation of TJ.</div><div><br /></div><div>ALFRED NOBEL</div><div><br /></div><div>Chemist who invented dynamite, and then dedicated his fortune to the Nobel Prizes out of remorse. A reminder to students of the power of knowledge to heal and to destroy.</div><div><br /></div><div>JACKIE ROBINSON\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Jackie Robinson was the first black player in the Major Baseball League. His entry faced tremendous turmoil in the 40s from 'separate but equal' advocates, yet his participation illustrated good players, regardless of race, could enhance professional sports.</div><div><br /></div><div>DAVID SAWYER\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Dr. Sawyer was the essential person who worked with business, government, and community organizations to launch TJHSST in 1984. In only 30 years, the school has maintained an international prominence, thanks to his vision and determination as assistant superintendent in Fairfax County Public Schools.</div><div><br /></div><div>NIKOLA TESLA\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>Nikola Tesla is a name forgotten in history for no apparent reason even after his research in Alternating Current, Radio, and Energy Transmission. An immigrant undaunted by failing mental conditions, Tesla exemplifies the classic 'rags-to-riches' tale, going from digging ditches at $2 a day to powering the World's Fair at Niagara Falls.</div><div><br /></div><div>HENRY DAVID THOREAU\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>A scientist, a philosopher, and the inspiration for the 'Civil Disobedience' of Martin Luther King, Thoreau challenges conformity and embodies the questioning spirit we hope TJ represents. \u00a0As he stated in his letter to a friend, H.G.O. Blake, on 16 November 1857: \u201cIt is not enough to be industrious; so are the ants. What are you industrious about?\u201d</div><div><br /></div><div>ALAN TURING <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre;\">\t</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He provided formal definitions for the concepts of algorithm and computation, and conceived the 'Turing Machine' which helped win WWII.</div><div><br /></div><div>ORVILLE AND WILBUR WRIGHT\u00a0</div><div><br /></div><div>The world has changed as a result of flying aircraft. The Wright brothers not only invented through experimentation, but they were daring enough to test the prototype vehicles themselves. Great role models for inquiry at Jefferson.</div><div><br /></div><div>MALALA YOUSAFZAI <span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre;\">\t</span></div><div><br /></div><div>Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist for female education and the youngest-ever Nobel Prize recipient.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/fcpsschools.net/forms/d/1krWnnO05_MtL5E7fmYW1YFQcZzltRzU1jUbSf18QvYg/viewform\">VOTE HERE</a></div></div><div><br /></div>", "updated": "2014-10-24", "author": "Scott Campbell", "added": "2014-10-24", "title": "Name the TJ Commons - Vote Now"}}, {"pk": 2660, "model": "announcements.Announcement", "fields": {"content": "<span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;\">Interested in international relations?

You must do combinations of C &amp; D or E &amp; F to visit two or four different sessions, and can do this on each Wednesday and Friday enabling you to visit in total up to eight different sessions.  </p><p>  Questions related to a specific lab or the mentorship program shall be addressed during these research lab visit sessions.  Students are asked to take necessary prerequisite courses to be eligible for TWO research labs so you have options next year during the application process.  These visits should help you focus on which labs to consider for your senior year and help you in scheduling possible prerequisites.
