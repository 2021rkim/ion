        <p>After logging in, you will reach the dashboard. This page shows, at a glance, new announcements for you and the TJ community as well as your current eighth period signups. To sign up for a block of eighth period, click the "Sign Up" button on the widget. If you have already selected an activity for this block, you may select "Change."</p>

        <p>This will take you to the Eighth Period homepage. On the top, you will see a listing showing all of the days containing a block of Eighth Period. Click on a block listed there to change the day you are viewing activities for.</p>
        <p>On the left side of the screen, you will see a listing of all the eighth period activities scheduled. To search for a specific activity, use the search box above the listing.</p>
        <p>To view more information about an activity, click on its name. More details about it will appear on the right. Buttons will appear that will allow you to "View Roster" or "Sign Up," if you are able. Some activities are restricted to certain groups, some are cancelled, and some fill up rather quickly. If you are unable to choose an activity to sign up for, a message will appear with an explanation.</p>

        <p>After selecting a user, you will be able to view their user page. If the user is a teacher, you will be able to see their class schedule, including which rooms they teach in during the day. If the user is a student, you will be able to view their student picture, emails, address, class schedule, and eighth period signups. However, some students restrict public access to this information, and information that has been hidden will not be visible to you. You also have the capability to restrict other students from viewing your information; visit the Preferences page to see what information others can view about you.</p>
