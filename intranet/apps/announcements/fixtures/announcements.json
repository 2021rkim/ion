For your teacher to be able to use Google Apps for Education with you, you'll need to sign up for the FCPS specific Google Apps for Education. The FCPS Google Apps for Education are set up so that you can only share and collaborate with folks with their FCPS accounts. That means that you won't be able to access those document with any other Google account. <br />Yes, that includes your own, personal G-Mail account. That might seem a little wonky at first, but it's done so that all students in FCPS have a happy and safe place to learn. So its done out of care and concern! For you!<br /><br />Here is how to get set up:<br />1) Go to the TJ Library Course found in Blackboard<br />2) The main menu (on the left) will have a Google Apps Button. Select the button.<br />3) On this page, you will see an option to ACTIVATE your account. Select this option.<br />4) Enter your FCPS network USERNAME and PASSWORD. The username is your Student ID number and it is the same info you use to get on FCPS mobile.<br />5) You'll be prompted to create a password for your new Google Apps account. You may want to use the same password as your Blackboard account. Just a suggestion to make your life easier. You'll need to type the new password twice. I'm sure you know the drill.<br />6) Viola! You'll be prompted to log in to your shiny new account. You might want to bookmark that log in page so that you can find it more easily in the future. <br /><img style=\"width: 204px; height: 204px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yyFtckPvoP8/TWv6k6yxp0I/AAAAAAAAAKg/yGxBKOnZGzo/app_sphere_google.png\"><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />    ",

We do not plan to eliminate any of the current routes, but instead consider redistributing buses where there might be a greater demand.<br /><br />  For example, suppose your base high school is Westfield, but its more convenient to take the bus from Chantilly high school since it might be on route to a work destination. By default, you are assigned to the Westfield bus, but we would actually prefer to assign you to a Chantilly bus if there is available space. If demand is really high at one school, we would investigate an additional bus at that location.

      "content": "Meng: The 2007-2008 school year has started, and it is necessary to finish the projects from last year ASAP. Biology and Chemistry ought to be finished before spring break. <br /><br />William: As you have probably noticed, TAP has been migrated! It is now running in its own virtual server. A consequence of this is that we are now running the latest and greatest MediaWiki software. Wonderful. Why do you care? Since things are actually considered stable now, and more stuff has been made secure, here are the two biggest things you need to know: <br /><br />1) Embedded images that link to external websites are no longer displayed. Please note that it is good practice (and it is now required) that you upload the picture into TAP. If the image disappears from or is changed on the other website, we will not be affected. However, you are still REQUIRED to place a citation for the image. Also, uploading the image to TAP means that, by viewing the page, a person doesn't have to connect to any other servers (in this case, less servers = more secure). <br /><br />2) Lead moderators are responsible for ensuring their AP pages are working. If there is a major issue, please contact William Yang to see if there is an easy fix. Un/fortunately, by migrating the wiki to a correctly configured server, AP French Language is a bit broken again. The accents are weird if you look at them in the All pages list (so whatever was used for the very first time the pages were created, go back to that).",
