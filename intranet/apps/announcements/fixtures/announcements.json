Some good choices are your M: drive and your UNIX filesystem, both available through intranet, as well as a USB drive. Also, on TJStar Day, please access your files through Intranet instead of logging out the computer and logging back in as this will be much faster.  If you are relying on wireless access on TJSTAR, please make sure that your device is configured to access the FCPSmobile network. Due to the large number of additional guests in the building, it is highly likely that the FCPS network will become congested and may be difficult to access. If your presentation relies on any multimedia files, please try to download them beforehand in case Internet access is slow.  Finally, if you are planning on presenting using your own computer during tjSTAR, please note that most of our projectors only have VGA ports for connecting computers. If your laptop does not have a VGA output, please email Andrew Hamilton immediately to verify the capabilities of the projector where you will be presenting.  If you have any last minute tech questions, please email ahamilto@tjhsst.edu.",

That might seem a little wonky at first, but it's done so that all students in FCPS have a happy and safe place to learn. So its done out of care and concern! For you!Here is how to get set up:1) Go to the TJ Library Course found in Blackboard2) The main menu (on the left) will have a Google Apps Button. Select the button.3) On this page, you will see an option to ACTIVATE your account. Select this option.4) Enter your FCPS network USERNAME and PASSWORD. The username is your Student ID number and it is the same info you use to get on FCPS mobile.5) You'll be prompted to create a password for your new Google Apps account. You may want to use the same password as your Blackboard account. Just a suggestion to make your life easier. You'll need to type the new password twice. I'm sure you know the drill.6) Viola!

TJ is one of five Fairfax County Public Schools and approximately thirty schools nation-wide who have been selected to participate in this assessment.   It is important that each student selected take part in the assessment. Each time a selected student does not participate, the accuracy of the results for the school may suffer. I urge you to support this effort.  It goes without saying that all of the information collected is completely confidential, including the results.  Individual students results will not be reported – only school-wide data. In fact, the study is required to do so by law.   Information on the PISA test can be found here.   Contact Dr. Heather Sondel, Assistant Principal with questions or concerns, in Room 229A.  UPDATE: New information – students are allowed to use calculators and rulers. Please bring your calculator and pencils to the cafeteria.  You will check-in in the cafeteria; attendance will be taken.",

We do not plan to eliminate any of the current routes, but instead consider redistributing buses where there might be a greater demand.  For example, suppose your base high school is Westfield, but it’s more convenient to take the bus from Chantilly high school since it might be on route to a work destination. By default, you are assigned to the Westfield bus, but we would actually prefer to assign you to a Chantilly bus if there is available space. If demand is really high at one school, we would investigate an additional bus at that location. To assist us in our planning, if you are a Fairfax County Resident, please answer this survey no later than May 18th.  Thank you for your cooperation.  Sincerely,  Evan Glazer Principal, TJHSST",

As many of you know, TJ installed 22 solar panels on our roof a few years ago due to EIC's efforts. If we can do it, the White House should be able to too!  Solar panels were first installed on the White House in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, but were taken down by President Ronald Reagan just seven years later. President Obama must put solar panels back on the roof to show that America is ready for a clean energy economy and that his administration is willing to lead the nation in this effort. Although President Obama promised on October 5, 2010 to have solar panels and a solar water heater on the roof by summer 2011, there has been no action whatsoever. He must follow through on his promise immediately in order to send a message to the world that the United States is ready to lead the clean energy revolution.  Please sign the Change.org petition here.  With a starting goal of 500 signatures, we can increase our efforts from there and really make a difference!  - Environmental Impact Club",

William: As you have probably noticed, TAP has been migrated! It is now running in its own virtual server. A consequence of this is that we are now running the latest and greatest MediaWiki software. Wonderful. Why do you care? Since things are actually considered stable now, and more stuff has been made secure, here are the two biggest things you need to know: 1) Embedded images that link to external websites are no longer displayed. Please note that it is good practice (and it is now required) that you upload the picture into TAP. If the image disappears from or is changed on the other website, we will not be affected. However, you are still REQUIRED to place a citation for the image. Also, uploading the image to TAP means that, by viewing the page, a person doesn't have to connect to any other servers (in this case, less servers = more secure). 2) Lead moderators are responsible for ensuring their AP pages are working. If there is a major issue, please contact William Yang to see if there is an easy fix. Un/fortunately, by migrating the wiki to a correctly configured server, AP French Language is a bit broken again. The accents are weird if you look at them in the All pages list (so whatever was used for the very first time the pages were created, go back to that).",

The question may be addressed in various venues: classes, 8th period activities, speaker series, a seminar course, etc.  It is not a requirement for teachers and students to integrate One Question into their work, and we hope you will get involved in some of the new opportunities across the school.  Seniors who find the question intriguing might consider it in planning their research projects.
