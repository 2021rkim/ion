Intranet3 (Ion) is the next-generation Intranet platform for TJHSST. Using Python, Django, Redis, Postgres, and many other technologies, Ion was developed from the ground up to be simple, well-documented, and extensible. Documentation (in RestructuredText format) is available inside the "docs" folder or at http://tjcsl.github.io/ion/ publicly on the web.

Version 3.0.0

**Ion now uses Python 3.** If you already have a Vagrant environment set up with Python 2, re-run ``config/provision_vagrant.sh`` to update dependencies.
